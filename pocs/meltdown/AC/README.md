# Meltdown-AC PoC

This folder contains a Meltdown-AC proof-of-concept implementation for x86_64.

## Compile

Compile using `make x86` for the x86_64 version.

## Run

Run with `./poc_x86` for x86_64.

If the PoC is successfull the output is
```

## How it works
In this PoC, we first enable a char buffer via malloc (malloc always returns aligned memory) and increment by one. We then enable alignment checking by setting the corresponding bit in the EFLAGS register. To get an unaligned memory access, we access our incremented char buffer as an int pointer, causing it to be unaligned. We then try to encode the result in the cache. Exception suppression is done either via Intel TSX or segfault handling.

## Troubleshooting

* The output is garbage (mostly just (random letters))
    + **Solution #1:** Manually set the variable `CACHE_MISS` in main.c to a threshold which allows distinguishing cache hits from misses.

* The program does not leak anything
    + **Solution #1:** Pin the program to one CPU core: `taskset 0x2 ./poc_x86`. Try different cores.
    + **Solution #2:** Cause a lot of interrupts by running e.g. `stress -i 1 -d 1`. This can be combined with Solution #1".
    + **Solution #3:** Manually set the variable `CACHE_MISS` in main.c to a threshold which allows distinguishing cache hits from misses.
